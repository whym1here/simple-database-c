# Learning 

## Sqlite
- [Arch Flow Chart](https://sqlite.org/zipvfs/doc/trunk/www/howitworks.wiki)
- Front-End:
    - tokenizer
    - parser
    - code generation
- Back-End:
    - virtual machine
    - B-tree
    - pager
    - os interface
- The **virtual machine** takes bytecode generated by the front-end as instructions. It can then perform operations on one or more tables or indexes, each of which is stored in a data structure called a B-tree. The VM is essentially a big switch statement on the type of bytecode instruction.
- Each *B-tree* consists of many nodes. Each node is one page in length. The B-tree can retrieve a page from disk or save it back to disk by issuing commands to the pager.
- The **pager** receives commands to read or write pages of data. It is responsible for reading/writing at appropriate offsets in the database file. It also keeps a cache of recently-accessed pages in memory, and determines when those pages need to be written back to disk.
- The **os interface** is the layer that differs depending on which operating system sqlite was compiled for. In this tutorial, Iâ€™m not going to support multiple platforms.
